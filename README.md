<strong>One-click, per-domain WP admin bar hiding. Great for those who often switch between design and content editing.</strong>

If you work with Wordpress on a frequent basis you may have a love/hate relationship with the admin bar. The admin bar is exceptionally handy when jumping between the front and backend of a site or when writing content but it can also get in the way when doing design or trying to build the aesthetics of a site. 

This plugin isn't developed for those who want to get rid of the admin bar completely, there are plenty of those extensions out there already. Wordpress Admin Bar Control is designed for easy concealment of the admin bar on a per-domain basis. This means all you need to do is click the plugin's action button once and the admin bar will vanish immediately and between pageloads and browser sessions. Want the bar back? No problem! Just click the button again and the admin bar will be restored instantly!
